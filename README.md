# CLI To-Do List (C++17, Linux, CMake)
A lightweight, terminal-based To-Do List application built from scratch in C++17 with a clean modular structure and a fully manual REPL (read–eval–print loop).
This project was created to deepen my understanding of C++ systems programming, command parsing, file persistence, clean architecture, CMake workflow, and Linux development practices.

# 🚀 Features

Add new tasks with auto-generated IDs
List all tasks with status (done/pending)
Mark tasks as done
Delete tasks by ID
Persistent storage using a simple plain-text format
REPL prompt (todo>) for interactive use
Fully cross-platform CMake build system

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: C++17
Build System: CMake
Editor/IDE: CLion (Ubuntu Linux)
Data Structures: std::vector, simple class-based model (Task)
Persistence: plain-text file I/O via <fstream>
Unit Testing: (framework name, if you later add it)

# 📚 What I Learned

**✔ C++ Systems Fundamentals**
Designing a clean class (Task) with private state and public getters/setters
Managing collections of objects using std::vector<Task>
Writing a manual REPL loop for continuous user interaction
Clean parsing of user commands and arguments

**✔ Linux & CLI Workflow**
Navigating directories and building projects via the terminal
Understanding how executables, builds, and file paths work on Linux
Using Git and GitHub for version control and code organization

**✔ CMake Build Skills**
Creating a portable CMakeLists.txt that compiles on any Linux system
Understanding targets (add_executable), include directories, and build folders
Running, rebuilding, and debugging using CLion’s CMake integration

**✔ Software Engineering Habits**
Maintaining a clean project structure (src/, include/, build/)
Using .gitignore to keep repos professional
Writing readable, maintainable, and testable C++ code
Planning iterations & features like a real software project

# 🧪 How to Build & Run (Linux / Ubuntu)
```
1. Configure the project
cmake -S . -B build

2. Build it
cmake --build build

3. Run the CLI application
./build/CLIToDoList
```
# ⌨️ Usage
```
todo> add Buy milk
todo> add Finish assignment
todo> list
[1] Buy milk (pending)
[2] Finish assignment (pending)

todo> done 1
todo> list
[1] Buy milk (done)
[2] Finish assignment (pending)

todo> delete 2
todo> exit
```
# 🧭 Future Improvements

Undo/redo support using an internal command stack
Better parsing (quoted descriptions, flags like --all, etc.)
Colored output and nicer formatting
JSON persistence
Unit tests using Catch2 or GoogleTest
Switch vector to std::deque or custom container for performance testing
Logging system for debugging and audit trails

# 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This To-Do List CLI is intentionally simple — but it demonstrates practical skills needed in real C++ developer roles:
State modeling
Iterative design
Command parsing
Text-based persistence
Systematic error handling
Clean CMake workflow
Linux development discipline

These are the building blocks for larger projects (databases, servers, CLI tools, game engine subsystems, telecom tools).
